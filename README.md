onMessage
=========

In order to run onMessage you must install pyramid: 

cd env
bin/easy_install pyramid

You can then run the server using:

cd ../ (You should be in the onMessage top level directory) 
env/bin/python pyramid/simple.py

The server should be running. If you can successfully open front-end/index.html in Safari then everything is awesome!

Backend capabilities require a full MAMP environment. The back-end files are here but can not be run without a complete setup.
